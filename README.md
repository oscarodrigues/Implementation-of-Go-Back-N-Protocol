# Implementation-of-Go-Back-N-Protocol

In this project, I:

• Developed a program that created network sockets and communicated information between both sockets.

• Added the functionality of error messages to relay information to user on which packets are expected and which packets were recieved.

To run the program, open the server.py file and then the client.py file. The program will send packets back and forth, displaying the working procedure of the Go-Back-N protocol.

If you have any more questions, feel free to message me!
